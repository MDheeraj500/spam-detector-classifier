This repository consists of a small learning project on NLP and my exposure to Git.
The project is about creating a model that can classify messages as spam or ham.
The dataset is taken form UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository -> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/228/sms+spam+collection

The methods used to preprocess the textual data is Lemmatization (using WordNetLemmatizer)
The vectorizer that is used is TF-IDF vectorizer.

The model used is Multinomial Naive Bayes (This is selected for the simplicity of the project)\

The project was carried out on a conda virtual environment inside a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
